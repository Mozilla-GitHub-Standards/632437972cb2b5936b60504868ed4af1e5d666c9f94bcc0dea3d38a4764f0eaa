# IAM Kubernetes Handbook

This handbook is structured in three parts:

* [EKS cluster management](create-and-destroy-eks.md) - Managing cluster resources in AWS.
* [Kubernetes administration](connect-to-eks.md) - Includes topics like user management and cluster addons.
* [CI/CD and manual deployments](cluster-addons.md) - Deploy a sample application through a CI/CD pipeline using AWS tools.

## Notes

Use these resources to setup a cluster, administer it, and extend it with addons like kube2iam and Calico.
