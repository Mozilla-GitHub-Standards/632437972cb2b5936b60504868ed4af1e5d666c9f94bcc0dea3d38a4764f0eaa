# EKS cluster addons

## Summary

These addons should be included with every cluster that we deploy. Today, I do
not have a method to do this programmatically while provisioning a new cluster
so I am documenting the steps required.

In the future, I would like all cluster management to be done programmatically
and these steps can be done as part of a post-deployment process.

## Instructions

### kube2iam

### Calico networking

### Custom role bindings

A CI/CD role / user in Kubernetes?
